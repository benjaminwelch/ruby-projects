# The Odin Project: Mastermind
##### Can you break the code?

This is my implementation of MASTERMIND. I did not implement the ability for the human player to chose whether they are the CODEMAKER or CODEMAKER. The human is always the CODEBREAKER.

I was a bit too ambitious and implemented things like:
- full MASTERMIND board in the terminal
  - getting this to work/look right took quite a bit of work.
- use of emoji so you can still play with colors like the hardware game.
- built instructions into the game.
- I made it a 3-round game, so you accumulate points over each round, highest score wins.

All in all, I really happy with how it turned out but the code is a mess. I'm very new to OOP and tried but yeahâ€¦ plenty more to practice and learn.

## How to Play:
download the project and run `ruby mastermind.rb`, you should be able to figure it out from there.

## future
I may return to it and add the CODEMAKER/CODEBREAKER choice for the user as well as some stuff to make the computer guess with a little bit of strategy. 

On the next project, I'll try to prioritize learning key concepts over design/usability of app. I want things to look/feel right for the user. Now I just need to apply that same idea to the code itself so things can look/feel right for me, other programmers.
